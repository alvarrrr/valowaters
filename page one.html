Valo Waters is a creative director and photographer from Finland. He lives with his dog in a house located in the nature of Pori. For his work he often travels abroad where he mainly works as a creative director. In his spare time he photographs the environment in which he finds himself. Early this year he started working on a series on underwater alienation. This work is based on a childhood trauma where Valo's brother drowned in a lake. Valo suffered from hydrophobia for a while. After a certain period of theraphy he recovered. he learned how to be in the water and how to relax and become weightless. His images are picturesque and convey an obscure somewhere in an enriching minimalist universe.

<p> In 2017, valo made a short documentary "Lefttome" about a pandemic. He filmed for 2 weeks in Belgium together with a friend. 
He used to live in Belgium, close to the Scheldt in Antwerp. On the other side of this river was the left bank. He absorbs this alienated part where he had never been before during this pandemic. </p></div>
